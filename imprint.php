            <h2>Payment:</h2>
            <p>
                Krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) accepts PayPal, Major Credit Card Payments and Bank transfers. All payments are to be paid or are paid upfront before delivery of the product. E.g. this means at the same time that services or products by krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) will only be delivered after receiving the payment(s), never upfront. Payments that are still pending and not being credited yet need to be credited first before delivery!
            </p>
            <h2>General </h2>
            <p>
            The license agreement(s) do not need to be signed by the customer(s)/licensee(s) and automatically become legally valid and active with purchase (payment needs to be fully credited) and receipt of purchased items.
            By making a payment, the customer (licensee) declares that he is fully aware of the entire content listed in the terms and conditions, he fully accepts and agrees to them.
            In case of possible changes in any of the listed points, or should one point become invalid or adjusted, all other points in the the terms and conditions stay unaffected and are still valid.
            Previously sold licenses and granted rights stay unaffected by future changes to the terms and conditions.
            Krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) has the legal right, but never the duty, to re-buy exclusive rights from the current exclusive rights license holder, for any amount of money, if the exclusive rights license holder agrees to it and wants to re-sell his exclusive rights back to the licensor.
            Interested parties, customers/clients, and licensees/license holders have the full responsibility to read the terms and conditions before making a purchase, and check for updates and/or changes in the terms and conditions on my website www.krispytunes.com.
            Krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) is not obliged for addressing any changes in the terms and conditions publicly at any time or in any form.
            For any point listed in this written agreement, any restrictions thereof and the general legal relationship, German Law is applicable in any case.
            If an instrumental contains sampled material, the sample-clearing of itself needs to be done by the customer(s)/licensee(s), never by krispytunes (Alper Kürtül).
            The customer(s)/licensee(s) understand(s) that they are responsible for clearing all samples that they choose to use and that the licensor cannot and will not be held liable for the misuse of any sampled material that the licensee uses in conjunction with the original instrumental composition that is being licensed in this agreement.
            The licensee(s) understand(s) and accept(s) that he/they only paid for the production work of the producer.
            The licensor does not claim to have/own any rights on any sampled material.
            Under no circumstances is a customer/licensee allowed to re-sell the instrumental itself or any modifications thereof, nor transfer the rights to the instrumental composition in any form to a third party, except for what is listed in the applicable license descriptions.
            Rights that are given to a customer are not transferable and non-refundable, if a customer/licensee features another or other artist(s), not listed as license holders in his license agreement by date of purchase, the issued rights to the instrumental-composition for use in licensee’s/customer’s song(s), featuring the concerned artist(s), are non-transferrable to other’s and non-splittable, for any kind of non-exclusive license(s) and remain bound strictly and solely to customer/licensee.
            All orders are final and cannot be changed/altered/adjusted/refunded afterwards, without licensor’s approval. No matter if exclusive rights or any other licenses are sold to a instrumental, krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) will always be allowed to use that instrumental for own promotional uses, without limitation, worldwide and throughout the universe, without terminability. Therefore all instrumentals sold exclusively may stay on the webpage or any websites and marketplaces they were offered, if licensor decides to.
            Customer(s)/Licensee(s) may edit/alter the length of a instrumental, mixing/mastering of a instrumental (use of effects, change of volumes/levels, etc.), and general modifications, such as structure of instrumentation (seperate tracklines), as they see fit, as long as they own a license to the instrumental and do not change the sound-structure of the instrumental itself, so that the instrumental becomes unrecognizable (e.g. only using drums or only using less than 70% of the entire sounds/instruments included in the original instrumental composition).
            It is also not allowed to use any parts, melodies, instruments, sounds, drum arrangements, etc. of the original instrumental composition for use in other compositions in a competitive product (for example: remixes or sampled music/instrumentals) without written consent and licensor’s approval.
            Remixes using any material of the original instrumental composition, or musical versions covering the original instrumental composition, played with live instruments (orchestra, band, etc.) are only allowed for unlimited leasing license owners or for exclusive license owners, in both cases only with written consent or a verbal agreement and licensor’s approval.
            Musical Composition(s)/instrumental(s) by krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) may NOT be uploaded on any website, marketplace or distributed in any form without his permission and written consent.
            Krispytunes (Alper Kürtül) is not responsible for any other website(s), marketplace(s), companie(s) or person(s) claiming to sell his instrumentals and owning rights to them, nor is kirspytunes (Alper Kürtül) legally responsible, nor liable/amenable for any damage, harm, financial losses or legal issues, caused by anybody abusing, disregarding or disrespecting the listed terms and conditions.
            Anyone found to be abusing and violating these terms and conditions or any other legal aspect concerning krispytunes's (Alper Kürtül's) music, content, or physical and/or intellectual property, will likely face a law suit and criminal punishment and be held responsible for copyright infringement.
