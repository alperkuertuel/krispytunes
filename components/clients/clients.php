                        <q>An uncomplicated collaboration focused on the end result. The quality and flexibility surpasses what I knew in this price segment. You can feel that it's about music and expression instead of making money.</q>

                        <q>Since his youth, Alper has reliably produced quality beats at such a delightful level that you inevitably get into the mood to fill his motivating sounds with accurate punchlines - as well as all the other moods on the atmospheric keyboard. For about ten years that I have been appreciating him, he has always been a correct person too. He is blessed with a special talent for harmony and always produces authentic beats.</q>

                        <q>krispytunes finds the perfect sound. For me, he produced beats that had a mix of old school and new school vibes. Dope drums with a catchy melody, but not according to the mainstream principle.</q>
