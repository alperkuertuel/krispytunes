        <summary class="accordion__item-title">What does a purchase include?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            Each purchase includes a license agreement/receipt stating your rights to the instrumentals, 
            payment details, etc., and the untagged instrumental as a wav-file & mp3-file. 
            Wav leasing rights include the stereo-mix of the instrumental(s) in wav-format & mp3-format. 
            Premium, unlimited, and exclusive rights also include the separated instrumental tracks 
            of the instrumental(s) in wav-format (also known as "tracked outs" or "stems") for professional mixing. 
            You will receive these files via download-links sent to your email address. 
            Please check your spam folder if you do not find the purchasing email in your inbox!

        <p class="accordion__item-content">

    <details class="accordion__item">
        <summary class="accordion__item-title">Do I have to pay for the license again when the license duration is over?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            Except for the exclusive license, all licenses have a duration of 3 years starting from the 
            date you purchased the beats. If you want to prolong your licenses for more years, you must 
            pay an additional fee. For the next 3 years, you pay the same amount as your initial payment. 
            To avoid paying fees after the 3-year duration, you can switch to an exclusive license or 
            cancel the contract under German law (3 months before the end of the leasing contract). 
            When switching to the EXCLUSIVE License, I will deduct the amount you already paid for the leasing.

        <summary class="accordion__item-title">Do you offer other payment methods than PayPal or Master/Debit card?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            YES! I also accept payments from any bank. You will receive a bill (PDF file) via email with all 
            the information you need. After payment, you will receive the instrumental(s) and rights via direct download link.

        <summary class="accordion__item-title">I own a WAV leasing license. Can I upgrade my license to a higher license?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            Please contact me via email. For license upgrades, I will credit the amount you have already paid 
            and deduct it from the price for the desired license.

    <details class="accordion__item">
        <summary class="accordion__item-title">Can I release a song made on your freebeat on Spotify or monetize it?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            Some of the freebeats contain samples, and you must clear the sample first before monetizing the song. 
            If you plan a profit release (if necessary: after clearing the sample), you must purchase a suitable license.

    <details class="accordion__item">
        <summary class="accordion__item-title">How do I give proper credit?</summary>
        <p class="accordion__item-content">
            Proper credit is given as follows in written form: "prod. by krispytunes". 
            Hard copies such as CDs, LPs, etc., need to include written credit in booklets, covers, or labels. 
            Streaming releases such as Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc., need to include written credit.
